/**
 * FigureDescendantsTester.java: Tests all the methods in the Figure Class and all of its descendants.

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Algorithm</b>:
 *    <ol>
 *        <li> First, declare and create an array of six  Figure  objects </li>
 *        <li> Instantiate two  Rectangle  objects, both with height = 10.3 and width = 8.0.  Assign
 *             to elements #0 and #1 of the array </li>
 *        <li> Instantiate a  Square  with a side of 20 and put into element #2. </li>
 *        <li> Instantiate a triangle with sides of 6.5, 14.9, and 11.3. Put into element #3. </li>
 *        <li> Instantiate a circle with radius of 4.31 and put into element #4. </li>
 *        <li> Instantiate another circle with radius of 8.15 and put into element #5. </li>
 *        <li> Write a loop that spins through all of the elements in the array </li>
 *            <ul>
 *                <li> invoke  calculatePerimeter()  on each object in the array </li>
 *                <li> invoke  calculateArea()  on each object in the array </li>
 *                <li> use  toString  to show the details of the object in the array </li>
 *                <li> if  toString  doesnâ€™t include perimeter or area, show those on a separate line </li>
 *            </ul>
 *        <li> Compare the  Rectangle  objects in elements 0 and 1 and determine if they are equal </li>
 *        <li> Compare the  Circle  objects in elements 4 and 5 and show if they are equal </li>
 *        <li> Compare the  Triangle  object in element 3 with the  Square  in element 2 and determine if they are equal. </li>
 *    </ol>
